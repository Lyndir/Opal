        The messaging package is used to wrap objects and messages into a structure that
        allows for transparant communication.<br>
        <br>
        Through the use of XML, all known objects can be encoded and transferred to a
        receiver, who can use this package again to reconstruct the original object.
        This allows for a dynamic and transparant communication of objects over any
        possible gateway. It will most likely be used with network communication and
        persistant storage.
