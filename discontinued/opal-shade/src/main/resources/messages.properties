# UI elements
ui.refreshPanel=Refresh
ui.checkVersions=Recheck Addon Versions
ui.accounts=&Accounts
ui.accountsTip=This list contains all the accounts that you've logged in on using your World of Warcraft copy. Choose the account for which you would like to upload data to the roster.
ui.accountsTitle=Account:\n
ui.appLoader=Launcher
ui.aceTip=Enabling this option will check the Ace SVN for updates to your Ace addons. This will yield in more Up-To-Date Ace addons, but be aware that these might sometimes be a little TOO up-to-date; and not yet ready for public release.
ui.aceTitle=Use The Ace SVN:\n
ui.ace=Use the &Ace SVN
ui.addonManager=Addon Manager
ui.addonPageNotFound=<html><h1 style='text-align: center'>Addon Manager Assistance page not found.</h1></html>
ui.advConf=Advanced Configuration
ui.appLauncher=Application Launcher
ui.autodetect=&Autodetect WoW
ui.autodetectTip=Disabling this setting will prevent any attempts to detect your World of Warcraft folder in the future. I don't really see much sense in doing that, though.
ui.autodetectTitle=Autodetect WoW:\n
ui.autostart=&Autostart WoW
ui.autostartTip=Enable this if you wish to start World of Warcraft as soon as NetherPanel gets started.
ui.autostartTitle=Autostart WoW:\n
ui.autoupTip=Enabling this setting will make NetherPanel monitor your files for changes at regular intervals (See 'File check interval') to see if they've changed; and upload them to the WoW Roster when they have. If you disable this option, you'll need to manually upload your character profiles.
ui.autoupTitle=Upload Automatically:\n

ui.guildProfilerNote=GuildProfiler is the World of Warcraft addon that collects the information about your guild and its members that UniUploader sends to the Guild Roster.
ui.guildRoster=Guild Roster
ui.gzipTip=Using GZip Compression for file uploads can greatly speed it up. The remote server does have to support GZip compression, and compressing data always stresses your processor to some degree. As such, this is not always a good idea; especially because you probably won't notice it if your upload takes 10 seconds or 20 seconds, because it happens while playing WoW or while shutting WoW down.
ui.gzipTitle=Use GZip Compression:\n
ui.gzip=Use &GZip Compression
ui.his='s
ui.home=Homepage URL
ui.homeTip=Specify the URL that the homepage button on the main page should open.
ui.homeTitle=Homepage URL:\n
ui.extlib=Use &External Libraries
ui.extlibTip=With this setting enabled, NetherPanel will enable its dependency management code and manage Ace addon dependencies for you.  This means your addons will always use the latest libraries and it saves some memory in-game when you have a lot of Ace addons that use the same libraries.
ui.extlibTitle=Use &External Libraries and Dependency Management:\n
ui.ignlog=Ignore &Changelogs
ui.ignlogTip=When this setting is enabled, changelogs are not installed along with the addons. This is handy for avoiding clutter-buildup, since some addons install new changelog files for each release. ACE addons are particulary notorious for this.
ui.ignlogTitle=Remove Changelogs:\n
ui.ignpat=Ignore &Pattern
ui.ignpatTip=You may want to keep some personal files in your addons safe from modification from NetherPanel. This field provides a regular expression pattern. Any files that match the pattern will not be modified by this addon in any way.\nThis is especially useful for people that have custom textures and such in their addon folders, or have modified the code of certain addons.\nThe pattern is in the PCRE dialect. Files that have any part of their pathname matched will be ignored.\n\n<i>For Example:</i>\nversion.txt\n.*tga|.*blp\n\n<i>For Info:</i>\nhttp://www.regular-expressions.info/
ui.ignpatTitle=Ignore Files:\n
ui.ignrepo=Ignore &Repositories
ui.ignrepoTip=With this setting enabled, NetherPanel will not manage addons that are in either a SVN, GIT or CVS repository to prevent deleting your local modifications to them.

ui.launcherTitle=Use the Launcher:\n
ui.launcher=Use the &Launcher
ui.md5=&Secure Login
ui.md5Tip=This option enables the use of MD5 hashing of the DragonFly CMS password. This is only useful if you're uploading to WoWRosterDF sites. Some WoWRosterDF installations support this, some do not; so play around with this setting a bit. Don't be too confident about the security this provides. MD5 hashing is not unbreakable and the password is still sent in clear text by UniAdmin (complain to them about this).
ui.md5Title=Secure Login:\n
ui.missingInfoTitle=Addon info is missing\!
ui.missingInfo=Please fill up the addon list first.
ui.mustDownload=<tr><th>[ Must download addon to find out ]</th></tr>

ui.postvar=Additional Post &Variables

Here are some known ones:\n<ul><li><b>DragonFly</b>: You will need the variables 'ulogin' and 'user_password'.\nTheir values should equal respectively your DragonFly username and password.</li><li><b>RPG Outfitter</b>: You will need the variables 'username' and 'password'.\nTheir values should equal respectively your RPGO username and password.</li><li><b>WoWRoster</b>: You only need the variable 'password' if you want to update guild member profiles as well as your own character data. Without the password variable specified, WoWRoster will still accept your character data.</li></ul><i>Right click to modify</i>

ui.proxyPassTitle=Proxy Server Password:\n
ui.proxyPass=Proxy Server &Password:
ui.windowedTip=Windowed mode prevents World of Warcraft from making itself full-screen. This means other applications can show on the screen as well as World of Warcraft, at the same time. You can turn on the Maximized checkbox in the World of Warcraft video options to make it look like full-screen mode, but with the added benefits of fast application switching (using Alt-Tab).
ui.windowedTitle=Use Windowed Mode:\n

ui.guildHomeTip=Guild Homepage:\nThis button opens your default webbrowser and navigates it to your guild's homepage.
ui.guildRosterTip=Guild Roster:\nThis button opens your guild's roster in your default browser.  The guild roster page is derived from your first upload URL.

ui.scheduleJump=Every:

(The format you see here depicits time for every timeframe below the selected timeframe above.)\n\nBasically, if you select 'Hours' for your timeframe and 2 for your timeframe step, you can input any time range from milliseconds up to minutes in this field.  As a result, the action will occur every 2 hours at the time written in this field.  If you write, for example, '20:01.0000' in this field, the action will occur every 2 hours at 20 minutes, and 1 second past.

You can customize when your characters get uploaded by scheduling this event.</li><li><b>The Works</b>: Upload character data if auto-upload is off and perform the three steps necessary to update addons automatically.</li><li><b>Startwow</b>: Start World of Warcraft.</li><li><b>Upload</b>: Upload the saved variables to the rosters.</li><li><b>Sync</b>: Contact UniAdmin to update current settings.</li></ul><b><i>Backend Events (I recommend you stay away from these):</i></b><ul><li><b>Languages:</b> Fills in the language box with available languages.</li><li><b>Wowdir</b>: Check whether the World of Warcraft directory is valid and try to find it if it isn't.</li><li><b>Setlang</b>: Update the User Interface for the selected language.</li><li><b>Settings</b>: Update all fields in the user interface with the setting values stored in the configuration.</li><li><b>List Addons</b>: Retrieve a listing of all available addons and check which are updatable.</li><li><b>Fetch Addons</b>: Download all selected addons in the addon listing.</li><li><b>Upgrade Addons</b>: Install all downloaded addons.

ui.forceUploadTip=Forced Upload:\nThis button will cause a forced upload of your character data to the upload URLs, even if no files were modified since the last time they were uploaded.\n\nIt might be interesting to know that if verbose logging is turned on, a forced upload will cause a dialog to appear that explains the result of the upload process in detail.  This might help you diagnose problems with the upload process.
ui.forceSyncTip=Forced Synchronization:\nThis button will make NP contact your UniAdmin and request its current settings.  This way, if any settings were changed in UniAdmin, the changes will be applied to your running NetherPanel.  This can also be handy in case you changed something to your NetherPanel's configuration and don't know how to revert it (eg. a URL).
ui.advSearch=Find Addons
ui.advSearchTip=Advanced Search:\nOpens a dialog window with all addons currently listed and a search box that lets you perform Perl Compatible Regular Expression searches on all addon descriptions.  This makes it very easy to find all addons for a certain purpose, especially if you have a very large list of addons (eg. ACE Addons is turned on).
ui.newTagFor=Created tag for %s.
