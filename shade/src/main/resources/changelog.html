    <title>NetherPanel v2 - Development Changelog</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>1.95 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Don't use cached addons when refreshing addon list; reload them from server.</li>
    <li>Addons now have an action property that specifies what exactly you want to do with them instead of just selected
        or not selected: current actions: install, upgrade, remove.
    </li>
    <li>Uninstalling addons now doesn't happen immediately. Addons are marked for uninstalling and are previewed as
        marked for installation in the next step along with the addons marked for upgrading/installing and are removed
        along with the installation of new and upgraded addons.
    </li>
    <li>Added a feature that marks all addons that are not requested and are not dependencies of requested addons for
        removal effectively cleaning up unneeded addons (handy for cleaning up Ace libraries).
    </li>
    <li>Toolbar by the addon manager has been changed a little -- should make more sense now to people.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.91a -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Added a feature that allows people to ignore addons that are in SVN, GIT or CVS repositories. Defaults to on
        (addons in repositories are ignored by default).
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>1.9a -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Forgot to re-enable splash screen.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.9 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Uploader code reworked largely. Multiple upload configurations are now possible.</li>
    <li>Beginnings of code that will let people switch between externalized deps and embedded deps.</li>
    <li>Fixed problems that occur when people move from embedded deps to external deps by automatically selecting all
        necessary (the existing fix deps option).
    </li>
    <li>Fixed UniAdmin problems.</li>
    <li>Fixed search field - it stayed red even on match.</li>
    <li>Search field now hops to the next match by pressing Enter several times.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.08-rc1 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue where the tag file was not updated with the new addon's version number.</li>
    <li>New: Addon preview images. Each addon is looked up on WoWInterface.com and have their preview images displayed
        and cached.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>1.07a -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Get rid of an annoying little info that triggered the console window before the main window appears.</li>
    <li>Reworked WoW Directory detection (prev commit).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Addon Versioning fixes - autodetect addon versions from source code and local version is now kept properly.</li>
    <li>Update addon information that's showing in the lists as it changes (eg. when an addon is uninstalled).</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.06a -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Oops. I deployed unstable code accidently. Quick-fix to make it runnable.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Remove a dependency on SUN's Java VM.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.05 -- Alpha</h1>

    <li>Make the progress bars look a bit better.</li>
    <li>Set WoWLauncher on by default.</li>
</ul>
<h1>1.04 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Show an exception dialog now when NetherPanel exits before being able to show the frame. No more invisible and
        impossible to debug exceptions.
    </li>
    <li>Keep outputting debugging logs on console even when the console window is up.</li>
    <li>Make all threads that should die after the UI disappeared daemon threads so the application can quit when
        unexpected issues caused the UI to crash and disappear.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>1.03 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>More graphical fixes of the new GButton and background and effects.</li>
    <li>New slash screen for NetherPanel.</li>
</ul>

    </li>
    <li>Addon manager now displays addons in categories. Only Ace addons support this, though.</li>
    <li>Massive overall fixes and reworks.</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.15.10 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue caused by addons that had a later version but didn't update any files. They would keep showing as
        out-of-date.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.15.9 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Wrote wrappers for Java 6 classes that are unavailable in Java 5; this way the code can be compiled on Java 5
        (for example - on MAC).
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.15.8 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Do not use no-ext ACE Addons; use the ace addons that actually include all their deps.</li>

        method of versioning.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.15.7 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Check whether the saved variable is readable before trying to MD5sum it.</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.15.6 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>

        when using systray.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.15.5 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Fix to become compatible again with the updated files.wowace.com; added some backend for a kick-ass addon
        management implementation with I might add later.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.15.4 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed some issues caused by the tooltips (mostly in Windows) (such as textbox loosing focus when tips show up
        and buttons need to be pressed twice for them to take effect).
    </li>
    <li>Fixed the buttons in the addon update/install preview pane that allow you to see a DIFF of each file that will
        be changed during the updating of your addons (very handy).
    </li>
    <li>Hopefully fixed the addon status thingy from wrapping itself to two lines in Windows (the [ADDON INST] thingy).
    </li>
    <li>Made the addon search bar activate immediately instead of waiting for you to type at least three letters of the
        addon name.
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.15.3 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Added german localization (translation).</li>
</ul>

    <li>Added a new feature that allows you to search through addon descriptions to find addons that do a specific
        thing.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the parser that occurs when there's } characters in notes and names etc.</li>
    <li>Made checking of addons some faster (mainly if you have a lot of ace addons).</li>
    <li>Should have fixed loading WoW on Macs.</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.14.8 -- Alpha</h1>

    <li>Cleaned up tooltip code a little more and profiled the memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<h1>0.9.14.7 -- Alpha</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Rework tooltips; they use far less memory this time - finally!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Fix logger messages for Out-of-Memory errors and other errors that have no source.</li>

    </li>

    <li>Modified file checks to only check for file existance, not whether they're regular files too (fixes symlinks).
    </li>
    <li>Fixed tooltips making a lot of threads which caused issues with some operating systems and configurations.</li>
</ul>
