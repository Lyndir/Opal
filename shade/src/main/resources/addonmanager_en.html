        <h1>The NetherPanel Addon Manager</h1>


        <h2>Welcome to the NetherPanel Addon Manager.</h2>

        <p>The Addon Manager enumerates all known addons so that you can install or update them easily.  Addons can be retrieved from both the Ace SVN and UniAdmin.</p>
        <p>For each addon that is installed on your computer two parameters are remembered:</p>
        <ul><li>The addon version.</li>
            <li>The reason why it's installed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The version is used to determine whether it's time to update the addon by comparing it to the latest version available online.<br />
        The reason why the addon's installed can be either because you want to use it or because another addon that you've got installed requires it.</p>
        <p>The addon manager will show two checkboxes next to each addon:</p>
        <ul><li><b>The first checkbox:  Determines whether this addon will be downloaded from the internet.</b><br />
                This will be the case when the addon needs to be installed or upgraded to a later version.</li>
            <li><b>The second checkbox:  Determines whether you use the addon.</b><br />
                This box will be checked for all addons that you wish to use and will be unchecked for all other addons.  If this box is unchecked but the addon is installed anyway, it's probably because one of the other addons that you have requires this addon.  Certain addons use features provided by other addons to do their work.  This reduces the amount of space that the former addon take up both on your hard disk and in your system's memory.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whenever you see an addon that you'd like to install, just click it and the addon manager will automatically select the appropriate checkboxes for you along with possibly marking checkboxes for other addons that are required by the addon that you clicked.</p>


        <h2>Upgrading addons</h2>

        <p>When you're ready selecting which addons you'd like to install and update, hit the Download button. The addons will be downloaded to your computer and stored in temporary files. The Addon Manager will then generate a report of what will happen during the installation of the addons.</p>
        <p>The report lists all the addons that will be modified or installed, and enumerates all the addon files. <b>Addon files that are going to be modified will have a light-bulb icon next to them. When you click the icon, a screen will appear explaining what modifications will be made to that file to update it (this is called, a diff, or a patch)</b>. You may close this window by rightclicking it, or focussing (clicking) the main window again.</p>
        <p>After you've examined the report, you can click the Install button to apply the listed changes to your addons.</p>
