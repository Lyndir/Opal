            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
               Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licenand conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

       from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and 

    4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
       then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable
       copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
       Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
       NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the
       Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
       Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
       NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
       License.  You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
       Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
       text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
       cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a

the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are
solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
permissions under this License.


8. Limitation of Liability. 

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.


9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. 

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and
on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only
if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any

            GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
               Version 2.1, February 1999 
 
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA 
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies 
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
 
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts 
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence 
 the version number 2.1.] 
 
                Preamble 
 
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public 
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. 
 
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some 
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the 
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You 
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether 
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better 
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. 
 
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, 
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get 
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of 
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 
these things. 
 
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. 
 
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis 
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave 
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source 
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide 
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them 
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling 
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
 
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. 
 
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that 
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is 
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know 
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original 
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 
introduced by others. 
 
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of 
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot 
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that 
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be 
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. 
 
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the 
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser 
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and 
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use 
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 
libraries into non-free programs. 
 
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using 
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a 
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary 
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the 
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General 
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with 
the library. 
 
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it 
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General 
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less 
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages 
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 
special circumstances. 
 
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to 
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes 
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be 
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free 
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this 
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. 
 
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of 
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in 
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating 
system. 
 
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is 
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 
that program using a modified version of the Library. 
 
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a 
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The 
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must 
be combined with the library in order to run. 
 
          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
 
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other 
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or 
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of 
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). 
Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
 
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data 
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. 
 
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work 
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the 
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under 
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a 
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is 
included without limitation in the term "modification".) 
 
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means 
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated 
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation 
and installation of the library. 
 
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of 
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from 
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based 
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for 
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does 
and what the program that uses the Library does. 
   
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's 
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that 
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the 
Library. 
 
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, 
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a 
fee. 
 
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion 
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and 
distribute sun version 2 of the 
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify 
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in 
these notices. 
 
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for 
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. 
 
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of 
the Library into a program that is not a library. 
 
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany 
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange. 
 
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to 
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not 
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 
 
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the 
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or 
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a 
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and 
therefore falls outside the scope of this License. 
 
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library 
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it 
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the 
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. 
 
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file 
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be 
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The 
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. 
 
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative 
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the 
Library will still fall under Section 6.) 
 
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, 
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 
 
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or 
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a 
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work 
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit 
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 
engineering for debugging such modifications. 
 
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work 
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one 
of these things: 
 
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the 
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified 
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood 
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the 
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application 
    to use the modified definitions.) 
 
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a 
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, 
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) 
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if 
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is 
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. 
 
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
    least three years, to give the same user the materials 
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more 
    than the cost of performing this distribution. 
 
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy 
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above 
    specified materials from the same place. 
 
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these 
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. 
 
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the 
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for 
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, 
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is 
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 
the executable. 
 
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you 
distribute. 
 
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the 
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library 
faciis License, and distribute such a combined 
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on 
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise 
permitted, and provided that you do these two things: 
 
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work 
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the 
    Sections above. 
 
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact 
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining 
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 
 
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute 
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any 
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your 
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, 
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 
 
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are 
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by 
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 
the Library or works based on it. 
 
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library 
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further 
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 
this License. 
 
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
excuse you frly your obligations under this 
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by 
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. 
 
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, 
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 
 
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
integrity of the free software distribution system which is 
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made 
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
impose that choice. 
 
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 
be a consequence of the rest of this License. 
 
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in 
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add 
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, 
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus 
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if 
written in the body of this License. 
 
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new 
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, 
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 
 
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library 
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and 
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a 
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by 
the Free Software Foundation. 
 
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free 
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, 
write to the author to aGE, THERE IS NO 
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
 
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF 
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 
DAMAGES.

   License

   THE  WORK  (AS  DEFINED  BELOW)  IS  PROVIDED  UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
   CREATIVE  COMMONS  PUBLIC  LICENSE  ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
   PROTECTED  BY  COPYRIGHT  AND/OR  OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
   WORK  OTHER  THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
   PROHIBITED.

   BY  EXERCISING  ANY  RIGHTS  TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
   AGREE  TO  BE  BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS
   YOU  THE  RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF
   SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions
    a. "Collective  Work"  means  a  work,  such  as  a periodical issue,
       anthology  or  encyclopedia,  in which the Work in its entirety in
       unmodified  form,  along  with  a  number  of other contributions,
       constituting  separate  and  independent  works in themselves, are
       assembled  into  a  collective  whole.  A  work that constitutes a
       Collective  Work  will  not  be  considered  a Derivative Work (as
       defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    b. "Derivative  Work"  means  a  work based upon the Work or upon the
       Work  and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
       arrangement,   dramatization,   fictionalization,  motion  picture
       version,    sound   recording,   art   reproduction,   abridgment,
       condensation,  or  any other form in which the Work may be recast,
       transformed,  or  adapted,  except  that a work that constitutes a
       Collective  Work  will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
       purpose  of  this  License.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the
       Work   is   a   musical   composition   or  sound  recording,  the
       synchronization  of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
       ("synching")  will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose
       of this License.
    c. "Licensor"  means  the  individual  or entity that offers the Work
       under the terms of this License.
    d. "Original  Author"  means the individual or entity who created the
       Work.
    e. "Work"  means  the  copyrightable work of authorship offered under
       the terms of this License.
    f. "You"  means  an individual or entity exercising rights under this
       License  who has not previously violated the terms of this License
       with  respect  to the Work, or who has received express permission
       from  the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
       previous violation.
    g. "License   Elements"   means   the  following  high-level  license
       attributes  as  selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
       this License: Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike.

   2.  Fair  Use  Rights.
   Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
   limit,  or  restrict  any  rights arising from fair use, first sale or
   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
   copyright law or other applicable laws.

   3. License Grant.
   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor  hereby  grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual  (for  the  duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
    a. to  reproduce  the  Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly,  and  perform  publicly  by  means  of  a  digital audio
       transmission  the  Work  including  as  incorporated in Collective
       Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
       publicly,  and  perform  publicly  by  means  of  a  digital audio
       transmission Derivative Works;

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
   known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
   such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
   in  other  media  and  formats.  All  rights  not expressly granted by
   Licensor  are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights
   set forth in Sections 4(e) and 4(f).

   4.  Restrictions.
   The  license  granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You   may  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally  perform the Work only under the terms of this
       License,  and  You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
       Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
       Work  You  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
       on  the  Work  that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
       the  recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
       not  sublicense  the  Work.  You must keep intact all notices that
       refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
       not  distribute,  publicly  display, publicly perform, or publicly
       digitally  perform  the  Work with any technological measures that
       control  access  or  use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
       the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
       as  incorporated  in  a Collective Work, but this does not require
       the  Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
       to  the  terms  of  this License. If You create a Collective Work,
       upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove  from  the Collective Work any credit as required by clause
       4(d),  as  requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
       from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
       the  Derivative  Work  any  credit  as required by clause 4(d), as
       requested.
    b. You   may  distribute,  publicly  display,  publicly  perform,  or
       publicly  digitally perform a Derivative Work only under the terms
       of  this  License,  a  later version of this License with the same
       License  Elements  as this License, or a Creative Commons iCommons
       license  that  contains  the same License Elements as this License
       (e.g.  Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike  2.5  Japan). You must
       include  a  copy  of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
       License  or  other license specified in the previous sentence with
       every  copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute,
       publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform.
       You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
       alter  or  restrict  the  terms of this License or the recipients'
       exercise of the rights granted hereunder, and You must keep intact
       all  notices  that  refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
       warranties.  You  may  not  distribute, publicly display, publicly
       perform,  or  publicly  digitally perform the Derivative Work with
       any  technological measures that control access or use of the Work
       in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.
       The  above  applies  to  the  Derivative Work as incorporated in a
       Collective  Work,  but  this  does not require the Collective Work
       apart  from  the  Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the
       terms of this License.
    c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
       above  in  any  manner  that is primarily intended for or directed
       toward  commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The
       exchange  of  the  Work  for  other  copyrighted works by means of
       digital  file-sharing  or  otherwise shall not be considered to be
       inten the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves the
       exclusive   right  to  collect,  whether  individually  or  via  a
       performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
       public  digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
       the  compulsory  license  created  by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
       Copyright  Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
       public  digital  performance is primarily intended for or directed
       toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

   UNLESS  OTHERWISE  MUTUALLY  AGREED  TO  BY  THE  PARTIES  IN WRITING,
   LICENSOR  OFFERS  THE  WORK  AS-IS  AND  MAKES  NO  REPRESENTATIONS OR
   WARRANTIES   OF  ANY  KIND  CONCERNING  THE  WORK,  EXPRESS,  IMPLIED,
   STATUTORY  OR  OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
   TITLE,    MERCHANTIBILITY,   FITNESS   FOR   A   PARTICULAR   PURPOSE,
   NONINFRINGEMENT,  OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
   OR  THE  PRESENCE  OF  ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
   SOME  JURISDICTIONS  DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
   SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   6.   Limitation  on  Liability.

   EXCEPT  TO  THE  EXTENT  REQUIRED  BY
   APPLICABLE  LAW,  IN  NO  EVENT  WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
   LEGAL  THEORY  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
   EXEMPLARY  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
   EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination
    a. This  License  and  the  rights  granted  hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals  or  entities  who  have  received Derivative Works or
       Collective  Works  from  You under this License, however, will not
       have  their  licenses  terminated  provided  such  individuals  or
       entities  remain  in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
       1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject  to  the  above  terms and conditions, the license granted
       here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
       the  Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
       to  release  the  Work  under  different  license terms or to stop
       distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
       election  will  not  serve  to withdraw this License (or any other
       license  that  has  been,  or is required to be, granted under the
       terms  of  this  License),  and this License will continue in full
       force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous
